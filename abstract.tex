In this paper, we use game theoretic modeling to explore the connections between privacy, polarization, and the passage of divisive laws.  Our framework is based on a population of citizens that influence what laws are passed, or what laws are maintained.  A law is defined in terms of how it impacts each individual, and our model is flexible in that it allows any set of effects.  We define a notion of divisiveness which allows us to measure the extent to which a law disproportionately affects different groups of citizens.
